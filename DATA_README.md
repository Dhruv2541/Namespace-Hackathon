# Data README

## Overview

This repository contains datasets and scripts for offroad segmentation using deep learning. The project focuses on segmenting offroad environments from RGB images.

## Dataset Structure

### Offroad_Segmentation_Training_Dataset
This folder contains the training and validation datasets.

- **train/**
  - **Color_Images/**: RGB images used for training the segmentation model.
  - **Segmentation/**: Corresponding ground truth segmentation masks for the training images.

- **val/**
  - **Color_Images/**: RGB images used for validating the segmentation model during training.
  - **Segmentation/**: Corresponding ground truth segmentation masks for the validation images.

### Offroad_Segmentation_testImages
This folder contains test images for evaluating the trained model.

- **Color_Images/**: RGB test images.
- **Segmentation/**: Ground truth segmentation masks for the test images (used for evaluation).

### predictions
This folder stores the output predictions generated by the segmentation model on test or new images.

### project_data
This folder contains additional project-related data, such as configuration files, logs, or intermediate results.

## Data Format

- Images are typically in common formats like PNG or JPG.
- Segmentation masks are usually binary or multi-class masks corresponding to different terrain types (e.g., road, grass, obstacles).
- Ensure that image and mask pairs have matching filenames for proper alignment.

## Usage

1. Place your training data in the appropriate subfolders under `Offroad_Segmentation_Training_Dataset`.
2. Use the scripts in `Offroad_Segmentation_Scripts` to train, test, and visualize the segmentation model.
3. Predictions will be saved in the `predictions` folder.

## Notes

- Maintain consistent naming conventions between images and their corresponding masks.
- If preprocessing is required, refer to the scripts in `Offroad_Segmentation_Scripts` for details.
- For any issues or questions regarding the data, check the main project documentation or scripts.

## Data Engineering Notes (Important)

### Segmentation Mask Values

The raw segmentation masks contain the following unique pixel values:

[100, 200, 300, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 7100, 10000]

These are **raw label encodings**, not class indices.

### Class Mapping Used

The following value-to-class mapping must be used during training and evaluation:

```python
value_map = {
    0: 0,
    100: 1,
    200: 2,
    300: 3,
    500: 4,
    550: 5,
    600: 0,      # noise / ignored (mapped to background)
    700: 6,
    800: 7,
    7100: 8,
    10000: 9
}
